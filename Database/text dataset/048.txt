And the Wall will come tumbling down. Wouldn't this make the perfect final shot for the end of Season 7? The White Walkers have got to get over that thing somehow, and we think bringing it down — whether it's via the Horn of Joramun or some other means — will be the only way they can overcome its magical barrier (which has been penning them North of Westeros for who knows how many years now).

The other possibility here, of course — which has also been widely theorised — is that Bran will inadvertently bring the Wall down (or at least disturb the magical barrier keeping out the Walkers) now that the Night's King has marked him.
