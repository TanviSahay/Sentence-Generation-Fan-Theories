JAQEN WAS HIRED TO KILL NED STARK. Another one to do with your favourite Faceless Man. Wonder why he's so obsessed with Arya? Maybe it's something to do with one of his recent(ish) tasks.

Perhaps the reason we saw such a badass supernatural assassin as Jaqen captured and in a cage, was because he was meant to kill Ned while he was locked in the black cells.

Cersei could have hired the FM to silence Ned and to avoid the inevitable unrest an execution would cause. However, her son Joffrey went rogue and killed Ned before Jaqen could get to him.

As the Lannisters wasted his precious time, maybe he purposely sought out Arya and has taken her under his wing in an elaborate plan to get his own back?
