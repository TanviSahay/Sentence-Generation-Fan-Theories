Sansa will go rogue. We think Sansa's increased levels of badassery will combine with her frustration over Jon getting all the credit for defeating Ramsay in the Battle of the Bastards (despite the fact he'd definitely have lost if it wasn't for her) and lead to her doing something reckless.

We don't think she'd intentionally harm her brother, but it's possible she'll do something behind his back again — possibly in conjunction with Littlefinger — that will have unhappy consequences.

It's less likely, but the other possibility is that she might go completely rogue. We know from George R. R. Martin's 1993 letter to his agent detailing the initial outline for A Song of Ice and Fire that he'd originally intended for Sansa to betray the Starks. Obviously his story has ended up changing massively since then, but who knows... maybe that's one element he decided to keep.
