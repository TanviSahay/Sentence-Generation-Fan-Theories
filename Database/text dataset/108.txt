Jon Snow is fireproof like Daenerys. We are now pretty damned certain that Jon Snow is Daenerys's nephew, although this still hasn't been 100% proven, despite the flashback scene at the Tower of Joy.

Assuming this is fact, then fans have reckoned that Jon's Targaryen blood has given him special powers that he doesn't even know he has (other than, you know, coming back to life and surviving epic battles despite crazy odds).

So maybe, like his aunt, he's immune to powerful heat and fire? Well, probably not. Other fans have also noted that not all Targaryens have this trait, as her brother Viserys would probably have shrugged off that molten gold thrown over his head. 

But we could still see some unexpected traits from Jon yet. Our money's on dragon-riding.
