More Names Checked Off Arya Stark’s Kill List.

In Season 3 Arya (Maisie Williams) began keeping a list of people she planned to kill. Much like Night’s Watch recruiter Yoren (Francis Magee), who told her about his own kill list prior to his death, the majority of the men and women listed had wronged Arya or her family in some way. At the close of Season 6 Arya crossed a major name off her list — Walder Frey (David Bradley), who hosted the infamous Red Wedding during which her brother, Robb Stark (Richard Madden), and mother, Catelynn Stark (Michelle Fairley), were killed.
