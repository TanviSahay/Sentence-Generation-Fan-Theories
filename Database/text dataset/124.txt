Wait, Is Sansa Pregnant?

One of Ramsay's final lines has got the internet going nuts. Ramsay tells Sansa, "You can't kill me. I'm part of you now." Many people are using this to revive the theory that Sansa is carrying Ramsay's child. While that would be horrible, it could also mean that he permanently scarred her in some physical way. We hope it's the latter, for her sake.
