The theory about all the Brans being the same Bran. If there's one thing that opens up a hell of a lot of doors for fan theories, it's time travel. This theory has been around for awhile, but it picked up steam again recently after the infamous Bran/Hodor warging incident from episode five. Basically, the theory goes that all the legendary Brans that Old Nan liked to bang on about — Bran the Builder; Bran the Shipwright, etc. — are actually all just one Bran. Our Bran.

How likely is it?

This theory seemed sort of ridiculous at first, but now that we know Bran can indeed influence past events it's starting to seem like more of a possibility. The thing is, we've wasted so much precious screen time watching him plod North to meet the Three Eyed Raven that there needs to be some sort of big payoff at the end. We think Bran is going to become a pretty powerful character, but at this stage we still don't know how powerful. Will he travel back in time and change history, living out entire lives in different ages? Maybe. Or is it more likely that he'll be a mostly silent observer, subtly intervening every now and then to help sculpt events? We think this option could be the more likely of the two.
