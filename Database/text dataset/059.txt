Sansa is pregnant with Ramsay’s child.

What this means: I really, really, really hope this one isn’t true. We all know that Ramsay Bolton spent many nights sexually assaulting his then-wife Sansa (because it was gross and we hated it). And we also know the Ramsay cryptically told her that she’d “never be rid of him” right before she “let the dogs out” all over his face. While I took his message to mean that she’ll always carry the emotional scars he gave her, others have interpreted that means she’s carrying his baby. 

If Sansa is pregnant with Ramsay’s child, that would be an emotionally devastating experience for her. She’d have to raise the child of a man she despised, forever reminded of how he physically, emotionally and mentally bruised her. However, there are plenty of other theories for what’s going to happen with Sansa next season, including marrying Littlefinger, betraying Littlefinger or [insert detail here about] Littlefinger. In short, we don’t know what lies in store for her, but I’m really hoping it’s not a “bundle of joy.”
