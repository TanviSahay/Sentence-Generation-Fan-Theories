JON WILL KILL DAENERYS. If Jon is the "Prince who was promised", he has to have the legendary sword  Lightbringer, which will only come about if it's quenched in "living fire" (specifically, the heart of a loved one).

Azor Ahai, the ancient legendary figure of the Red Priests' religion, did just this by plunging it in the heart of his (willing) wife. So, he may have to sacrifice Dany to do it.

Stannis thought he had made the real Lightbringer, but Maester Aemon made it clear that this wasn't the case, as the sword was not radiating any heat. This is getting far too complicated, now.
