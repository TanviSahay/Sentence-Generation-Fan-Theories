Euron Greyjoy will control a dragon.

What it means: I don’t think Euron Greyjoy is going to be a problem for very long, since Theon and Yara have teamed up with the Mother of Dragons. However, I do think he’s going to be the source of Dany’s first major Westeros battle, and it’s not going to be pretty. For starters, Euron is a seafaring man, while most of Dany’s army has little experience on the ocean. Second, there’s that horn. 

In the books, Euron Greyjoy acquired a horn called Dragonbinder while searching the ruins of Old Valyria. He claims it can be used to control a dragon, but it hasn’t been tested. We haven't seen Euron with Dragonbinder in the series so far, but he could definitely surprise Dany and her army. If someone used one of her own dragons against her it would be devastating for Dany. I’m thinking he’ll use one, mess things up for a while and then be dispatched. I previously predicted he could be a major player, but now, not so much.
