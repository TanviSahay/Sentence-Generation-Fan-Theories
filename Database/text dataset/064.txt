Jon Snow and Meera Reed are twins. This is predicated on the idea that Meera's dad Howland Reed was the only person at the Tower of Joy with Ned Stark when Ned's sister Lyanna handed over her baby (Jon Snow) and begged Ned to protect him. What if Lyanna had a second baby, and Ned asked Howland to take her and raise her as his own? Also, Kit Harington and Ellie Kendrick kind of look alike.
