Three heads of the dragon.

"The dragon has three heads" is a well-known prophecy in Westeros. While many assume each of the heads must be a Targaryen, George R.R. Martin has stated that's not necessarily the case. One of the dragon heads is presumably Daenerys, who's already bonded with her dragon, Drogon. But as for the other two ...Jon and Tyrion - both of whom might be Targaryens - are the most popular picks for the remaining two dragon heads.
