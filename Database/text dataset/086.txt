Tommen or Jaime will kill Cersei.
Way back in the day, Cersei and a pal visited a witch who told her she would be queen until a younger and more beautiful woman cast her down (Margaery?), after which she would be killed by "the valonqar," which translates to "the little brother." That could be Tyrion, or her twin Jaime, who was born moments after Cersei. Or it could be Tommen, her younger son, who the High Sparrow seems to be getting his hooks into.
