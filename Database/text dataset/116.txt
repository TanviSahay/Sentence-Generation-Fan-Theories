BRAN IS THE LORD OF LIGHT. Another Bran theory: that Lord of Light that the Red Women bangs on about is actually the second-youngest Stark.

The idea goes that the voices that whisper to the priests and priestesses are actually Bran warging back in time while trying to build an army of fire-bearers to beat the White Walkers. This action eventually gets turned into a full religion.

The Lord of Light is supposedly looking for the "prince that was promised" to defeat the Walkers, and the prime candidate right now is Jon Snow (Melisandre's previous candidate: Stannis Baratheon). It makes sense that if Bran was doing all the promising that he has picked his step-brother as the "chosen one".
