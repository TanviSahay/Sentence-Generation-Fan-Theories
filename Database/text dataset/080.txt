Jon Snow, son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.
This one is very well known, and generally accepted as true: Jon Snow is not Ned Stark's bastard son, but is actually the offspring of the deceased Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen -- and thus also heir to the throne of Westeros.

In the season 6 finale, it's confirmed that Jon Snow is Lyanna's child, and heavily implied that Rhaegar is the father -- though not 100% confirmed.
