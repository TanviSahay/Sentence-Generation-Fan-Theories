Bran Stark caused the Mad King to go mad. This theory gained more prominence after the episode where Bran inadvertently went back in time (or something) and caused Hodor to lose his mind. If Bran has the ability to manipulate the space-time continuum, maybe he also traveled back in time to tell Aerys to burn the White Walkers, only Aerys didn't get it and tried to burn King's Landing instead. A similar theory posits that time-traveling Bran also warged himself into Jaime Lannister and pushed himself out the window, in order to prevent an even more cataclysmic future.
