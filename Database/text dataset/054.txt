Bran will bring the White Walkers to Westeros.

What this means: Dammit Bran, you had one job. And that was not to bring the zombie army to Westeros. Well, in a way, that’s everybody’s job, but I think it’s going to be Bran who ends up failing it. Not by breaking down the wall, but by taking away its magic. Remember in The Door how Bran was marked by the Night’s King, therefore allowing the White Walkers access beyond any magical barrier he hid behind? Well, there’s a giant magical barrier between Bran and Westeros, and sooner or later he’s going to need to cross it. 

Unless Bran comes up with a way to remove the brand, and it doesn’t seem likely, he’d basically be leaving a “Please Come In” sign for the zombies after crossing. The White Walkers won’t need to break down The Wall, because Bran’s going to leave the door unlocked for them. Not cool, Bran. Not cool.
