Cleganebowl!

If the Hound did survive his battle with Brienne, that would give weight to the popular fan theory that suggests Sandor Clegane (The Hound) and his brother Gregor Clegane (The Mountain) will face each other at some point.

The fact that the Mountain has risen again only fuels this theory more ... though the exact circumstances of such a fight remain anyone's guess.
