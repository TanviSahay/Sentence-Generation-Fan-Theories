Jaime kills Cersei.

The fifth season began with a flashback to young Cersei getting her fortune told by Maggy the Frog. The prophet warned Cersei that she'll have three children with gold crowns, but that after all of her children have died the "valonqar" (Valyrian for "little brother") will choke Cersei to death. Cersei seems to assume Tyrion is the prophesized valonqar, which explains her deep-rooted hatred of him. But ...
her twin brother, Jaime, was born after her, putting him in the running as well. And ever since Jaime lost his hand, the pair's relationship has grown more and more complicated.

He loves his sister, but we wouldn't put it past him to kill Cersei, eventually, for the good of the kingdom, just like he once did with the Mad King.
