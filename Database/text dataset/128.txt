Tyrion is a Targaryen.

Remember when Tywin Lannister told Tyrion, "You're no son of mine"? What if he meant it? In the books, Daenerys' dad, the Mad King, was infatuated with Tywin's wife, Joanna. George R.R. Martin also describes Tyrion as looking radically different from Cersei and Jaime. Instead of the golden Lannister hair of his siblings, Tyrion is said to have blonde hair so pale it's almost white, much like the silvery hair of the Targaryens.Tyrion is also said to have had a life-long fascination with dragons, even dreaming of them when he was younger.
