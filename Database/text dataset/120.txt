THE FACELESS MEN'S GOD IS ACTUALLY MONEY. Perhaps the Faceless Men and the Iron Bank –both major institutions of Braavos – are actually in league with each other and structurally affiliated?

The Iron Bank is known as the richest organisation in the world, and has enough money to bring down entire regimes. If you don't pay them back, someone's going to get you. Maybe a Faceless Man?

The FM charge huge fees for their services but the fees are also relative to the wealth of the person hiring them and who the target is. A wealthy person will pay more than a poor person, but the proportions will essentially be the same.

The FM may not flaunt their vast wealth, so where does their money go? Maybe to the Iron Bank, which then lends it out and forces its will on foreign regimes, so that the FM can then continue their influence on the world.

All this would lead to the idea that the Many-Faced God is actually money, and the impact it has on people. This is why they don't care who hires them and what for, they just want the cash to then inject into the Iron Bank (their god).

What did Jaqen give Arya as a token to get into Braavos? A coin.
