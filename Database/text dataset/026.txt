Sam leaves for the Ruins of Valyria to search for information about the creation Valyrian steel. He read about the Doom of Valyria and in the process finds the cure for Greyscale, a maester seems to have known something already via Shireen. He meets Jorah, not quite fully consumed yet, and helps to cure him. Jorah, now immune to Greyscale, enters Valyria and finds the secret to Valyrian steel.

Unfortunately, he also brings tomes with history of the ruin, which Sam discovers is tied to Rh'llor, and Jorah realizes that Dany is bound to commit the same destruction, but he tells no one. Dany aids in the destruction of the White Walkers, but Jorah finally learns to put honor above love and has to act against Dany to save Westeros from her madness.
