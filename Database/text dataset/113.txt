SANSA IS PREGNANT WITH RAMSAY'S KID. That would just be so GoT wouldn't it? Sansa is finally safe, and then she realises that she's carrying the spawn of the devil.

The theory began after her little chat with Littlefinger, in which she attacked him for allowing her to marry Ramsay Bolton. Speaking about that horrible wedding night, she said: "I can still feel it. I don't mean 'in my tender heart it still pains me so' â€” I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."

Fans have debated whether she is referring to a literal baby inside her rather than physical and emotional pain. Jon Snow later commented on her new large coat (to accommodate her child?) and that she didn't want to eat the Night's Watch food (though, can you blame her?).

If it were true, Sansa and her team would want to do anything they can to prevent Ramsay from finding out, as having an heir would consolidate his rule over Winterfell.

It would also be a horrible, horrible turn of events.
