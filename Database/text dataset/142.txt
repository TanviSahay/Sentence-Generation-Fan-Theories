R + L = J + M.
A slightly muddled extension of the R + L = J theory that basically argues Meera Reed is Jon Snow's twin sister. Remember that Howland Reed — Meera's supposed father — is the only other man apart from Ned that survives the fight at the Tower of Joy — this theory suggests that Lyanna died while giving birth to twins, and that Ned and Howland took care of one each.

How likely is it?

Okay, so Jon and Meera do look sort of similar, but to be honest we think this one might be a step too far. Having Jon Snow turn out to be the Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne would already be a big enough twist without throwing a secret twin sister into the equation. Add to that the fact that the Meera theory began picking up steam when it looked like Jon might be dead — back when there was a vacancy for a surprise Targaryen heir, in other words — and we reckon this one might have had its day.
