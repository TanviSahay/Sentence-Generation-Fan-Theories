Targaryen Twins? Well, now that we have one Lannister who may not be a Lannister at all, why not add more fuel to the fire. If King Aerys did jump the turnstile and cut in front of Tywin on his wedding night, maybe he was the one who fathered Jamie and Cersei. They do have the blonde hair and penchant for incest that tends to run in the Targaryen clan.
