Bran and Meera are found by one of the men of the Night's Watch and taken to the Lord Commander Edd, who decides to take them to Winterfell. The wall will not fall because of Bran (it will fall at the end of the season, but for another reason).

In Winterfell, Bran will meet with Jon and Sansa, and Jon will offer the place of King in the North to Bran, who refuse. Bran will contact Howland through dreams, and ask for him to come to Winterfell.

Howland then confirms Jon's paternity (and now, my fool personal desire, he will arrange an engagement between Bran and his daughter Meera).
