Bran made the Mad King go mad.
When Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven traveled back to the events outside the Tower of Joy in the May 8 episode, Bran was apparently able to shout and be heard by the younger version of his father, Ned Stark. What if, going back further, the "whispers" that the Mad King Aerys Targaryen heard were simply Bran trying to talk to him and it was actually he who set in motion the events of the show?

The events of season 6, episode 5, seem to indicate this is very possible.
