LADY STONEHEART WILL ARRIVE VERY SOON. In the books, Catelyn Stark didn't stay dead for too long after the Red Wedding, as she was resurrected by Beric Dondarrion (that bloke with the eyepatch who kept coming back to life in earlier seasons).

Thereafter known as Lady Stoneheart, Catelyn went on a hellbent mission to kill anyone remotely connected with the Red Wedding. Fans have longed for her to make an appearance on the show, and recent events have pointed towards this finally happening.

The sudden comeback of her Frey-held brother Edmure may be the catalyst for Stoneheart's arrival (he'll probably get murdered in some horrible way, let's be honest). Meanwhile, both Jaime and Brienne are also heading straight for Riverrun. We won't spoil things too much, but let's just say that the books featured a huge and eventful reunion for the pair, orchestrated by Stoneheart.

Maybe Jon Snow's resurrection at the start of the season was a precursor to Catelyn coming back to life, so that it won't feel completely bonkers. Plus, they made sure to include Catelyn front and centre in Bran's latest vision. Foreshadowing, much?
