Daario is Benjen Stark.
When Daario was recast after one season, the reason given was he was too hot. Well, he looks completely different from the previous Daario, but an awful lot like a younger version of Benjen Stark, who disappeared early in Season 1 and hasn't been heard from since. Maybe he's doing a task for Maester Aemon, who in the books bemoans that he's not by Daenerys' side? This would be a weird twist, yes. And, no, the theory doesn't imply that there are two Daarios, but rather that they made the casting change when they found out George RR Martin's ultimate designs for him.

UPDATE: As of the May 29 episode, "Blood of My Blood," which saw the return of Benjen Stark in Westeros, this really ridiculous theory is DEBUNKED.
