There's a dragon living under Winterfell. The Stark ancestral home is notably situated on top of hot springs that keep it warm throughout Westeros's years-long winters. What if the hot springs are actually caused by the breath of a dormant dragon? Alternatively, what if the dragon is an ice dragon, or just a metaphorical dragon that is actually Jon Snow because he's really a Targaryen? Please put on your tinfoil hats and begin the debate.
