Littlefinger falls hard, maybe even dies. The North is not like the political arenas he mastered in the South, he may be able to manipulate honorable men like Ned but I don't think he truly understands how the Northern Lords work. Lord Royce already hates him, Robin is apparently in the Vale, and the Knights might turn against him. Sansa working with Littlefinger would be a blatant ruin of her development and opinions on trusting the man who got her into the Ramsay mess in the first place, she may have problems with Jon but she will not side with Littlefinger. Littlefinger will have no idea how to react to the magical plot getting closer. He can play the game of men but White Walkers and undead are a whole different story. Littlefinger is finally out of his element and I think its going to cost him.
