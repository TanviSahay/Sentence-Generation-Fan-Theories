Tyrion Targaryen. You may have heard rumblings of this theory because it has started picking up some major steam recently. Basically, this theory postulates that Tyrion might be the child of Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryen. That's right, Ser Barriston did tell Dany that the Mad King (her father) had quite a thing for momma Lannister and may have claimed first bedding rights on her wedding night to Tywin. The theory claims that that the affair possibly continued and Tyrion was the result. It has its sensible origins. After all, maybe that's why Tywin truly loathed him so much and constantly said that he's not his son. Also, wasn't it a little odd that Tyrion was able to unchain and basically charm Dany's dragons?
