Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are going to get married. She could benefit from a well-connected husband with a band of loyal supporters behind him, and he could benefit from her army and her dragons. The nephew/aunt thing isn't an issue either, since Targaryens have always been down to marry each other when the need arises.
