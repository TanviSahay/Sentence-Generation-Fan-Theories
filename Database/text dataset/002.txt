The Return of Gendry.

Aryaâ€™s close friend and confidant, Gendry (Joe Dempsie) was last seen in Season 3. Melisandre (Carice von Houten) convinced Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane) that they needed drops of his blood to please the Lord of Light. After getting what she needed from him, he was temporarily freed though it was implied that Melisandre wanted to kill him. Ser Davos (Liam Cunningham) released him, setting him up with a small paddle boat and rations of food to last through his journey, which we have yet to pick back up with.
