Meera Reed is Jon Snow's twin sister.
Ned Stark's trip to the Tower of Joy could be even more eventful than the previous theory would imply, if this is true: Lyanna gave birth to not one, but two children. Meera's alleged father Howland was also at the Tower of Joy, after all. So basically the idea here is they're Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
