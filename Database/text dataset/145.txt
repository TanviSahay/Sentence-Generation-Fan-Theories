The theory that Bran caused the Mad King to go mad. We know Bran can alter the past (#HoldTheDoor, y'all), but what if he's responsible for setting the whole show in motion? This theory posits that during a vision into the past, Bran sees King Aerys and tries to reason with him — maybe even warning him about the White Walkers. Unfortunately, all the king hears are whispers, which make him lose his mind and start burning his subjects alive. Thus, sparking the rebellion that caused all this mess. Nice going, Bran.

How likely is it?

We're thinking this one's a keeper. We've already seen Bran influence the past — in fact, we saw him disconcert young Ned Stark when he called out to him at the Tower of Joy. Who's to say he won't disconcert King Aerys, too?
