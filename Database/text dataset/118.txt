JON WILL KILL DAENERYS. As the original book series was named A Song of Ice and Fire, it's fair to assume that the end game will involve Jon Snow (Ice) and Daenerys (Fire) in some way. Whether they'll be together or against each other remains to be seen, but one theory states that Jon will be forced to kill his potential lover/family member/something else.

The epic theory goes that Daenerys actually ends up being Westeros' main threat rather than its saviour, as she goes insane, much like the Mad King before her. She and her dragons will bring ruin to the Seven Kingdoms. Be honest, she was looking a tad tyrannical at the end of episode 6. Jon Snow will be the one who discovers the Horn of Winter and actually commands the army of White Walkers (who are actually good guys?), wakes up an alleged Ice Dragon and takes on the Dany and her three dragons in one fell swoop. Still with us?
