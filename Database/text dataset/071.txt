That cat Arya used to chase around the Red Keep is Princess Rhaenys Targaryen. At the very least, the cat is probably Balerion, the black kitten Rhaenys kept before she was killed during the Sack of King's Landing. To take it further, the Targaryens (like the Starks) have historically been able to warg, and Rhaenys accidentally warged into Balerion right before her death. Or it's just a stray cat getting up in everybody's business.
