Bran remembers how the touch of the Night King allowed them to break in last time, and makes Meera leave him behind so that she can spread the word. Maybe the latter part of this won't happen, but I'd like to think that Bran would have learned his lesson from the last time, and thus refuses to cross the Wall. Maybe Bran will have to sacrifice himself by staying behind. There's also the possibility that he refuses to cross the Wall, but is then forced to by a concerned member of the Night's Watch and shit gets fucked up anyways. But then again, someone in the Night's Watch would have no trouble believing him, considering their likely first-hand experiences with White Walkers.
