Jaqen H'Ghar is pulling all the strings.

In the books, Jaqen is assumed to be the "Alchemist" who murders Pate at the Citadel before taking on Pate's identity. Balon Greyjoy is also seemingly murdered by a Faceless Man, who may or may not have been hired by Balon's brother Euron. Regardless of whether both kills were committed by Jaqen himself, it's clear that he and the Faceless Men are interfering in the game of thrones - it's just not obvious whose side they're on, or how widespread this secret conspiracy goes.
