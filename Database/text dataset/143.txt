The theory that Sansa Stark is pregnant with Ramsay Bolton's child. A Redditor argues that Sansa dropped plenty of pregnancy hints in Episode 5: She's making a new dress, she can't stomach the food at Castle Black and she says she can "still feel" — physically — Ramsay's assault.

How likely is it?

In the world of the show, this seems like a plausible circumstance. Ramsay wants a Stark heir, right? But it would be a huge deviation from the books — in those, Ramsay marries Jeyne Poole, a friend of Sansa's from Winterfell masquerading as Arya. Ramsay and Sansa never even meet. Plus, there are alternate explanations for all the clues above: Sansa wants a new dress to appear noble when she's recruiting northerners for her army, it doesn't seem like anyone is fond of the food at Castle Black and Sansa certainly doesn't need to be pregnant to feel the effects of Ramsay's abuse.
