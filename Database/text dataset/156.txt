Robert Baratheon Cursed The Starks. This one is another entry into the category of super crazy but kind of possible. According to Reddit user NANAs_mic, in the pilot episode, King Robert Baratheon shows up at Winterfell and the Stark clan greets him. The thing is that whoever Robert touched eventually died. That part is fact, but the theory says that Robert had a legitimate cursed touch of death. Of course, he didn't touch Sansa or Bran and Jon wasn't allowed to stand with them (#bastardproblems). Those three are still kickin'. Well I don't necessarily think that Robert had a cursed touch of death, it is kind of weird that everyone he laid a finger on is gone.
