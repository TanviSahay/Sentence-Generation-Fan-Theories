House Umber is part of a "grand Northern conspiracy" to put the North back in the hands of a Stark.

In season 6 we saw lord Smalljon Umber drag Rickon Stark and Osha in front of Ramsay Bolton as a "gift" to demonstrate House Umber's loyalty to Ramsay as Warden of the North. However, what he didn't do was any of the traditional shows of loyalty like kneeling or kissing Ramsay's hand and so forth. The thought is that maybe House Umber remains loyal to the Starks and are part of a group of houses prepping to take back the North with a Stark at the head again.

With Rickon dead and Lord Umber fighting pretty hard for Ramsay in the battle at Winterfell, we can safely consider this one DEBUNKED.
