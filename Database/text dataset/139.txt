Cersei isn't killed by a Lannister.

The valonqar who kills Cersei doesn't necessarily have to be her younger brother - or even a brother at all.

High Valyrian uses the male gender when gender is actually unknown, and Maggy wasn't fluent in the language to begin with, so it's possible that Cersei's killer could be any younger sibling, from Daenerys, to Arya, to the Hound.
