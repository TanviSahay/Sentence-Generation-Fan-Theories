Ned Stark Is Alive. Wouldn't this be nice? In the books it is said that Sansa doesn't recognize her father's head and Catelyn does not think his bones are big enough to be from his body. So people are saying that he may have either warged (because all Stark's are apparently warging enthusiasts of the highest order) or Syrio Forel is a Faceless Man and took Ned's place to effectively save him from being executed. There's a lot of moving parts here and I don't think any of them really work.
