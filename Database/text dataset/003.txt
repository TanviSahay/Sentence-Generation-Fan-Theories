Samwell Tarly Will Step Up to The Plate.

According to a “Game of Thrones” fan theory, thought up by writers at Uproxx and Vanity Fair, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley-West) may be more of a key character than viewers previously believed. At the end of Season 6 he finally arrived at the citadel with Gilly (Hannah Murray) and baby Sam in tow. The episode featured a scene in which Samwell looks out over the vast library of books housed in Oldtown, but it’s what’s hanging above the books that tells much about the upcoming episodes of the HBO show.

The Citadel library has a large gyroscope chandelier hanging above it. The light fixture should look familiar to fans of the show, as it is featured in the opening credits. The theory suggests that this is confirmation that Samwell, who is training to be a maester, will be tasked with keeping a written record to close friend Jon Snow’s adventures as well as the other happenings in the Seven Kingdoms. This is based off comments George R.R. Martin has made suggesting that the show will play out like “Lord of The Rings,” in which one character is telling the story for others. Should this theory prove true, it is a sure sign that Samwell or baby Sam will survive the impending attack from the White Walkers.
