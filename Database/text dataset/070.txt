Tyrion Lannister is a Targaryen. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him, which is one reason Tywin Lannister always treated him like dirt. Believers in this theory further speculate that Twyin hated Tyrion because his actual father was Aerys Targaryen, who claimed "bedding rights" over Joanna on Tywin's wedding night. Also, Tyrion is pretty good with those dragons.
