Jaqen H'Ghar is Syrio Forel.

In the first season, Arya's "dancing instructor," Syrio Forel, helped her escape by taking on a group of Kingsguards with a wooden training sword, but we never got confirmation of his death.

So when Arya befriended another Braavosi, Jaqen H'Ghar, many assumed the Faceless Man was the First Sword of Braavos in disguise.

But ... sadly, actress Maisie Williams, who plays Arya, seemingly crushed this theory when she said showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss insisted to her that Syrio really is dead.
