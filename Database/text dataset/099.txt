Sam will discover how to make Valyrian steel and meet Gendry.

The legend of Samwell Tarly is often forgotten in A Song of Ice and Fire. His story is lost amongst tales of dragons, dwarves, bastards, and assassins. Sam has often lived in the shadow of Jon Snow, but I believe his day of major plotline is coming. The last time we saw Sam he had arrived at the Citadel in Old Town with Gilly and little Sam. He had been ordered by the (at the time) Lord Commander Jon Snow to be trained to become a Maester to Castle Black.

The theory: We see Sam standing in a massive library at the end of season 6. I'm assuming that Sam's plotline in season 7 will be discovering a way to defeat the white walkers. It's not too far of a stretch to assume he'll discover a book that instructs how to craft Valyrian steel. As far as I remember in the show, Sam Tarly doesn't craft steel. So it's also not improbable to think he might need a blacksmith once he discovers that secret.. if only there was a blacksmith that was last seen on a rowboat going into hiding in season 3. Oh wait, Gendry just might have decided Old Town was a good place to hide from Cersei and Stannis.

That last little tidbit with Gendry is an enormous reach but it's not a crazy way for the show to bring Gendry back to the story and make him relevant relatively quickly.

On a sidenote, when the f**k is Sam gonna find out Jon Snow died, left the nights watch, fought a war for the north, or became King in the North.
