Gilly's son will take down the White Walkers. Well, sort of. Young Samwell could potentially end up being key to defeating the overall baddies of the series, according to a Reddit theory.

Gilly's son is most likely the very last true son of the evil Craster who wasn't turned over to the White Walkers. That makes him technically the brother of various White Walkers, and knowing Craster's dirty history he probably shares bloodlines with gods know who.

The user suggests that big Sam's arrival at the Maesters' Citadel will mean that he will discover a prophecy that could make little Sam a prophet for both humans and for the White Walkers, and could help bring peace to all.

Though, that would make a rather dull finale, wouldn't it? More likely that the White Walkers still want the child that was promised to them, and Sam's Valyrian steel sword may come in handy.
