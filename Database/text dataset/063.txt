Varys is actually a merman.

What this means: Everything. This means everything. This is the probably the most spectacular thing I’ve ever heard. You know how Varys and Littlefinger are basically caught in their own game of thrones? We now know why Littlefinger’s doing it, because he wants power. But what does Varys want? Well, according to Nerdist, it’s simple: He is a merman and he wants to free his fellow merpeople. You heard that right. And not just any merman, but a member of the “merlings” species, which exist in A Song of Ice and Fire. 

The biggest hook (get it?) for this theory is the speed in which Varys traveled from Dorne to Dany’s ship. While the showrunners have chalked it up to pacing, others have loosely speculated that it’s because Varys actually has a tail. There’s even the belief that Dany’s dragons could melt the ice in The North so much that the entire Seven Kingdoms will turn into a giant ocean, leaving only merlings … and Littlefinger, because that dude will never die.
