Jamie lannister.
The richest house in Westeros would be an enticing opportunity for Dany and it is also common knowledge that Jaimie is well loved by the ladies. If Dany could just look past that he's been banging his sister (and fathering bastards) his whole life maybe this could.. oh yeah, he stabbed her father (the Mad King).
