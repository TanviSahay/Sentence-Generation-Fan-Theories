Varys Is A Merman. This theory from Redditor AllegraGeller claims that Varys is actually a merman. Of course, there is pseudo-evidence to back this up. The user postulates that he has a "slimy smile." The user goes on to say, "This could be interpreted to mean he does not show his teeth, and that could be because he has very abnormal teeth," aka merman teeth, whatever those might be. Also, Tyrion threatens to throw him into the sea at one point and Varys is super unconcerned and says something along the lines of, "The results of that might bum you out." (I'm paraphrasing). You can read the rest of the user's evidence at the link above.
