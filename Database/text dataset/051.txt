Tyrion Lannister is a Targaryen.

What it means: Jon Snow isn't the only Targaryen around. Tyrion Lannister is also believed to be one of the prophesied heads of the dragon along with Dany and Jon. It comes from the theory that mad King Aerys Targaryen had an affair with Tywin Lannister's wife, Joanna, the mother of Tyrion, which might explain why Tywin hated him so much. And despite what happens in the books, the TV show is pointing in that direction, with Tywin saying you're no son of mine just before Tyrion shoots him with an arrow. 

We’ve also seen a strong connection develop between Tyrion and Dany, with her trusting him above almost anyone else. While some have speculated this could be Tyrion falling in love with Dany, I see it more as a familial bond. But hey, that hasn’t stopped Targaryens before, right?
