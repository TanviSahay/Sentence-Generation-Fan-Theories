Bran is actually Bran The Builder.

What it means: For those who don’t know, Bran The Builder was the man who created Winterfell and raised The Wall over 8000 years before the events covered in Game of Thrones. There’s belief that our Bran and the former Bran are one and the same person because of his ability to influence the past. We already know Bran can see into the past and future, and he can influence events and 'warg' into people. “Hold the door,” anyone? 

If he's aware of the White Walkers in the present day, maybe it's his responsibility to travel into the past and raise The Wall to keep them out. Also, in the books Old Nan mentions - on several occasions - that Bran's favourite stories are the ones about... yup, Bran The Builder. Is that an echo of the young Stark's future? Maybe.
