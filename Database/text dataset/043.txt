Jon will find out about his real dad. Now that Bran knows about Jon's true parentage, we can't see why he wouldn't spill the beans when he eventually makes it back to Winterfell. Then again it did take Bran a full four seasons to make it beyond the Wall in the first place, so who knows how long it'll be before he finally gets back to his hometown.

Whether the revelation comes in Season 7 or the beginning of Season 8, though, it seems inevitable that Jon is going to find out about his Targaryen heritage at some point (this will likely be the catalyst for an eventual alliance with his aunt Daenerys, after all).
