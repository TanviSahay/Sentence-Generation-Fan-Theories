A Daenerys Vs. Cersei Face-Off.

Fans aren’t the only ones speculating about Season 7. Clarke is ready to find out what’s in store for the Khaleesi and even has a few ideas of her own as far as what she hopes goes down. The British actress told Entertainment Weekly she is hopeful that her character will get to face-off with Cersei. She told the publication that the cards are stacked in her favor, given her acquisition of ships and men and the lack of shirtless distractions.

“If we talk about this: basically, I’ve got ships, I’ve got manpower, I’ve got dragons that breathe fire, and I apparently cannot be killed. I don’t even have an attractive man who wants to take his shirt off anywhere near me now, so there are no distractions. Though we have yet to see Tryion without his clothes on. The only thing missing is Jorah [Iain Glen]. He’s gotta come back. I said I can’t rule the Seven Kingdoms without him,” she said.
