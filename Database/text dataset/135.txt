Daenerys Targaryen is Azor Ahai.

A poor translation of the prophecy lead everyone to believe that Azor Ahai would be male. However, since dragons are neither male nor female, it's highly possible that Daenerys could be the prophesied leader. After all ... she was born on the island Dragonstone "amidst salt" and later reborn as the Mother of Dragons on Khal Drago's funeral pyre "amidst smoke."
