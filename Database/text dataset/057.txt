Greyscale will be used as a biological weapon.

What this means: If Jorah succeeds in finding a cure for greyscale, that means Daenerys would have a weapon more powerful than any army, a disease. Daenerys could threaten Westeros with a greyscale epidemic, therefore ensuring that more people would side with her without spilling any blood. However, if Dany ended up having to use the greyscale, even if she and her supporters were protected, it could come with a catch. 

As mentioned in Hitflix, greyscale turns people into Stone Men, unable to think or feel. In that sense, they are very much like wights, and we could see another zombie army on our hands. There are also rumors that we could see the arrival of the Shrouded Lord, a mythical figure who’s basically the Valyrian version of the Night’s King, who can curse others with greyscale through his kiss. Can you imagine if the White Walkers had a dragon-scaled zombie army to contend with, instead of just the humans? Or would those armies team up and completely lay waste to the Seven Kingdoms?
