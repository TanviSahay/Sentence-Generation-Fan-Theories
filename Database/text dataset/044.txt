Daenerys will take care of Euron Greyjoy. Seeing as showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have already cut plenty of Martin's book characters from the TV show (including Victarion Greyjoy), we can't see why they'd bother including Euron unless he has a reasonably big part to play in the upcoming season.

At the moment, Euron's main beef is with Theon and Yara (who ran off with a bunch of his ships) and his main mission is to make Daenerys his bride. The last time we saw him, he was making the slightly ambitious request of his Ironborn friends to help him build "a thousand ships" so he could chase after them.

We think Euron is likely to pop back up early on in Season 7, giving the Mother of Dragons a handy warm-up snack before she swats Cersei off the Iron Throne.
