Little Finger/ Robert Aryn.
This is my dark horse in the marry Daenarys sweepstakes. Little Finger is such a beast at playing the game of thrones that I can't imagine a scenario that he won't find someway to toss his name into the running for marrying Dany should the opportunity present itself. If he doesn't throw his name in the running then I would assume he'd throw in his puppet Robert Aryn into the mix at least. I don't think this would happen but I believe he would get very close to tying the knot.
