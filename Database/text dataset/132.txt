Bran wargs into a dragon.

The Three-Eved Raven told Bran he wouldn't walk again, but that he would fly. And as Bran's warging abilities grow stronger under the Raven's tutelage, it's well within the realm of possibility that he could warg into one of Dany's dragons. Plus ...this could make Bran one of the three much-predicted dragon heads, even if he isn't an actual dragon rider.
