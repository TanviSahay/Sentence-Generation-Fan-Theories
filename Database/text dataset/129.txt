Meera Reed is Jon's twin.

One theory posits that Bran Stark's pal Meera Reed is actually Jon Snow's twin sister. On the show, the actors bear more than a passing resemblance, and in the books, they're the same age. Howland Reed was also present at the Tower of Joy when Jon's maybe-mom Lyanna died after giving birth. Reed he would have been at the right place and the right time to adopt Meera as his own.
