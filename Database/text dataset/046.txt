Cersei will die at the hands of Jamie. Cersei may be on the Iron Throne for now, but it's going to be one hell of a short-lived reign. Not only has she succeeded in making enemies of practically everyone in the Seven Kingdoms, but now she's even gone and alienated her own brother.

This one's been the subject of plenty of theories and speculation, and we think it's got legs â€” we don't know what the exact circumstances will be, but we reckon Cersei will ultimately die at the hands of Jamie (thereby fulfilling the prophecy given to her by Maggy the Frog when she was a child).
