The Night's King is a Stark.

We've now seen the way that the Night's King came to be. He was created by the Children of the Forest as, essentially, a defense mechanism, one that has since gone rogue.

Legend has it, the Night's King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who became the de facto leader of the White Walkers after falling in love with a woman whose "skin was as cold as ice." That legend doesn't quite seem to be true anymore. But ... according to Old Nan, this commander (besotted or not) was ... Brandon Stark.

It's not clear whether the poor sap who had a piece of dragon glass shoved into his heart could technically be a Stark ancestor. But if he is, then his interest in Jon at Hardhome could be explained as the villainous leader recognizing his kin.
