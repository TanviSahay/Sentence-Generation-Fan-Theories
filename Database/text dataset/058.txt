Arya becomes Lady Stoneheart.

What this means: No, Arya isn’t going to die and be resurrected as the vengeful spirit of justice. But it does mean that Arya will fill the void Lady Stoneheart left behind. For the past couple of seasons, I’ve been waiting with bated breath for Lady Stark to emerge as the corpsified Lady Stoneheart, but alas, the season 6 finale all but confirmed that’s not going to happen. 

However, Arya is back in Westeros and ready to continue her campaign of vengeance against all who wronged her. She could totally meet up with the Brothers Without Banners and take over as their leader. Especially with the support of the Brothers’ recent acquisition, The Hound, who time and time again has shown his complete respect for Arya. Interestingly, should this storyline emerge, we could see a fascinating role reversal between the two characters, with Arya being blinded by hate and violence, and The Hound trying to keep her balanced.
