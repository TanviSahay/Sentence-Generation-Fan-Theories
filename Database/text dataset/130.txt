Ramsay Bolton is Jon's twin.

Ramsay and Jon are approximately the same age and both have black, curly hair. As bastards in the North, they even share a last name (at least until Roose legitimized Ramsay).

But while Jon would have inherited the Stark nobility, Ramsay got the Targaryen insanity. However, it's unlikely that Ned would have given one of his nephews away to a miller's wife in Bolton lands, so we doubt this theory holds much weight.
