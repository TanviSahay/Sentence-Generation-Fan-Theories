Jaime will kill Cersei. 

What this means: With the death of Tommen, Maggy the Frog’s prediction that all of Cersei’s children will die has come true. However, there’s one more tidbit that concludes the childhood prophecy: Cersei will be killed by her “Valonqar,” or little brother. A lot of people have taken that to mean Tyrion, who’s currently en route with Dany’s army to kick some Westeros ass. However, he’s not Cersei’s only little brother. Jaime, Cersei’s twin, was born a few minutes after her. 

The last time we saw Jaime, he was horrified, watching Cersei take the crown. He is clearly not happy with the direction the kingdom and his family are taking. Even though Jaime has said time and time again that Cersei is the most important thing in his life, that may be tested if someone else in his life is threatened, such as Brienne of Tarth, or even the Stark sisters (who he’s sworn to protect). And, given Jaime’s reputation as the Kingslayer, it would be heartbreakingly poetic justice to have Jaime kill the Mad Queen, too.
