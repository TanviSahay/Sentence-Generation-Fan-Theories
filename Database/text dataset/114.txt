BRAN BUILT THE WALL. Now that we've seen Bran time travel more than Doc Brown, all kinds of theories have sprung up about what he might do. We've already discussed how he might turn the Mad King mad in the first place, but what if he was the same Bran who built the Wall?

Remember Old Nan talking about all those Brans in the past? Bran the Builder, Bran the Shipwright etc. What if Bran was EVERY SINGLE BRAN? All Bran, if you will.

Maybe he travels back in time and subtly influence events to make sure they turn out the way they're meant to? He makes sure that the wall is built to protect everyone from the White Walkers (becoming Bran the Builder), and he is also the person who creates the "There must always be a Stark in Winterfell" rule, to make sure he and his brothers are actually born in the first place.
