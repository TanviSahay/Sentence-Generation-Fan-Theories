Arya Stark Will Die.

What I think Arya Stark will actually do is possibly take a few more names off her kill list. There are a ton of characters in the River lands right now (the Hound, Brothers Without banners, Brienne, possibly Melisandre). I think Melisandre and the two leaders of the BWB are the most ripe for the young Starks pickings. I believe after her assassination of Waldur Frey her head is going to be massive and after taking a few more heads she might think she can go after a certain Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Whether or not she has a huge burned face partner in this plot is a variable I can't say for sure, but I do hope so. I really do believe that Arya will die on this last mission. She's my favorite character and I hate making this prediction but it just seems the fate of this lost child. There's no place for her at Winterfell, she's not going to just hold up in a tower until Jon marries her off to some random Northern Lord and I can't see her by Jon's side in the final battle against the white walkers. I think her story ends in King's Landing, getting absurdly close to killing Cersei but somehow failing.

The only alternative path I see to this is maybe possibly hopefully after she kills the leaders of the BWB, the Hound takes over as their leader (another theory I'll bring up later) and she serves as the Hounds right hand and they ride North to help Jon in the big fight.. we can dream can't we.
