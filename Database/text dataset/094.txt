Jon Snow.
Being the only character big enough to rival Dany's definitely gives Jon a legitimate shot at becoming Mr. Daenarys Targaryan. However, the problems with this match is that if Jon is Rhaegar Targaryan's son, then that would make Dany his aunt. Incestuous type relationships among Targaryan's wasn't an uncommon thing, but I'm not sure how the Starks felt about that. But Jon and Dany were raised on different sides of the world so it's not like they would have been raised as nephew and aunt (but still that's kind of gross). My last reason I have trouble seeing this pairing work is because say at the end of the show Jon and Dany manage to defeat Cersei and the white walkers and decide to get married. Can anyone possibly picture Jon Snow sitting on the iron throne in King's Landing for the rest of his days. Or try and picture Daenarys sitting on a throne in Winterfell. I think at this point in the show Jon would do similar to Ned Stark and pass on the opportunity to wear the crown.
