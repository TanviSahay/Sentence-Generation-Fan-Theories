Euron greyjoy.
Outside of his own claim to his niece and nephew about giving the Mother of Dragons his one eyed snake, Euron has no chance of this happening. This is probably the least likely match I could see happening on this list for the simple reason that Theon and his sister have already met Dany and turned her against Euron. I could see him offering Cersei his allegiance for marriage but, aside from that this is pretty open and closed.
