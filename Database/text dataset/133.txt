Aegon Targaryen is alive.

When Robert Baratheon overthrew the Mad King, he killed every Targaryen he could find. But in the books, one Targaryen, Aegon, was allegedly swapped with another child by Varys and raised by Illyrio Mopatis in secret as Young Griff.

That character has yet to appear in the show - that is, unless ... he's a character we already know? Some fans have suggested that Samwell Tarly or Daario Naharis could secretly be Aegon, although neither are described as looking very Targaryen in appearance.
