Jon Snow is Azor Ahai, or the Warrior of Light.

What it means: Now that we’ve gotten that pesky “R+L=J” theory out of the way, because it’s totally canon now, we get to look further into what that means. The biggest is whether he is the Azor Ahai, or the Warrior of Light. All signs point to yes. Melisandre’s prophecy states that Azor Ahai will have the blood of the dragon and will be reborn in smoke and salt (in the books Jon's wounds smoke and his comrades cry salty tears all over him). Whenever she’s looked into the fires for Azor, she’s only seen things to do with snow, which can’t be a coincidence. In addition, Jon picked his Night's Watch post over his lady love (Ygritte), which ties into the original Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa prophecy.
