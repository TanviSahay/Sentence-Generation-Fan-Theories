Quaithe is a time traveler and possibly also Daenerys, come from the future to teach her past self what to do. Remember that masked lady back in season two who gave Daenerys that prophecy she's been using to guide her all over Essos? Well, this theory posits that Quaithe is wearing a mask to hide her true identity from her past self, because the first rule of time travel is you don't let your past self see your future self. Hermione knows all about it.
