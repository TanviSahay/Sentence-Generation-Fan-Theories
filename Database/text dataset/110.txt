Jorah will be saved by unicorns. This may sound silly at first (and it is), but hear us out. A Redditor came up with a theory that would be incredible if it turned out to be true.

Daenerys has sent Jorah on his own quest to find a cure for his fatal disease, greyscale. What mythological creature is known for its healing properties? The unicorn!

In the books, the Northern island of Skagos – ruled by House Stark – is thought to be the home of unicorns. Although it is also rumoured that the "Skagosi unicorn" is just a huge one-horned goat.

But let's say they're unicorns. Why not? We've had giants and White Walkers. F**k it. 

Plus, Skagos isn't too far away from Bear Island, where his family, the Mormonts are stationed. Sort of makes sense, right?
