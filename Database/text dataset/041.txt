The Starks will fully reunite. It won't happen straight away, but at some point next season we believe all the remaining Starks will be together again. Jon and Sansa have already been reunited, Bran is now back at the Wall, and Arya has already returned to Westeros â€” all the pieces are coming together, in other words. We know that Game of Thrones loves symmetry, so it makes sense that a story which started with the scattering of a family will be bookended by the remaining pieces of that family drawing back together.
