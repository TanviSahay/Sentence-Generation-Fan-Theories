Robb Warged Into Greywind And Is Alive. This theory has been around for a while. As a seriously devoted Robb Stark/Richard Madden fan, I really want to believe that he made it through The Red Wedding. I'm usually cool with any theory that allows me to believe this is true. Unfortunately this particular one just doesn't make any sense. Basically, it says that Robb warged into Greywind before he was killed by Roose Bolton. That's great but it simply didn't happen. First, we would've seen him warg since his face was shown the whole time and he clearly didn't warg. Second, even if he did warg into Greywind, Greywind was killed too. Either way, Robb died. Everyone stop making me relive that moment.
