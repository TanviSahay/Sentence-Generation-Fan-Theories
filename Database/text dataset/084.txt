Missandei is a Faceless Man.
The Faceless Men are surely going to have a big part to play in the endgame of "Game of Thrones" considering Arya's whole arc these past two seasons, but they haven't been directly involved at all so far. Or maybe they have? Missandei has ridiculous language skills and a nearly-always-consistent tone of voice -- these are Faceless Men traits.
