The Wedding of Ice and Fire.

What this means: Snow and Fire. Black and Blonde. Cute and Cuter. Yes, people have been shipping Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen since basically the beginning of the series, and for good reason. They’re both attractive and awesome and cool and they’d make super cute babies. Overall, an alliance between these two is a smart idea. She’s the Dragon Queen, and he’s the newly crowned King of the North. No one would be able to stop them. 

While I’m sure an alliance with a handshake would be enough, wouldn’t it be so much cuter if they got married? Sure, they might be related, but that’s kind of been the Targaryen M.O. for a long time. In the end, these two need to team up, not only to stop Cersei and her reign of insanity, but also to put an end to the White Walker invasion that’s coming, because winter and all that.
