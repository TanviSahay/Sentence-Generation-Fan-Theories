Jon Snow May Fulfill The Azor Ahai Prophecy.

On July 5, Movie Pilot brushed the dust of a fan theory from three years ago, which suggests that Jon Snow may be the second coming of Azor Ahai, the god which the red priests and priestesses answer to. Much of the theory, posted by Reddit user OneEyedCheshire, aligns with where the show is in Season 6. Should the theory prove true, one corner of Westeros will turn into a zombie-plagued wasteland before “Game of Thrones” wraps. The chosen one — who, in this case, would be Jon Snow — will swoop in to save the day, forging a special sword called the Lightbringer and driving it through the heart of his beloved to end the suffering of those around him.

The Reddit post suggests that Winterfell is Lightbringer, as it meets all the criteria. It was tempered by water when House Greyjoy briefly seized it in Season 2. It was then proverbially driven through the lion’s heart in Season 6, episode 9 when Jon Snow and Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) defeated House Bolton, which worked under the Lannisters. OneEyedCheshire writes that the final forging will come in the form of a betrayal.

“Now the third forging. I think this leads to the ‘bittersweet’ ending GRRM [George R.R. Martin] has promised, and Dany’s third betrayal. After Dany makes it to Westeros, I believe J = R + L will be revealed, and Jon and Dany will fall in love. This will be in the middle of the fight against the others,” the Reddit user speculated. “I believe two of Dany’s dragons will have died by this point of the invasion and she will be left with only Drogon = her soul. Dany will be Nissa Nissa [Azor Ahai’s beloved] and Jon Snow must bind her soul (Drogon) to Lightbringer (Winterfell) in order to fight back the Others.”
