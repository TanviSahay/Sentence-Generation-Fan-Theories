Syrio Forel & Jaquen H'ghar Are One. This one has a little evidence to back it up. A theory has been circulating for a while now that these two men are one in the same. After all, the Faceless Men can literally be anyone. They are no one. The fighting styles, coupled with their similar ways of speaking ("a girl is not ready"), make this theory a crazy, yet somewhat plausible one. There's also the old standby that we never saw Syrio bite it. As fans, if we don't see the death, we have an obligation to question it.
