Arya will become Lady Stoneheart.
It's safe to assume that book fans' hopes of Catelyn Stark being revived from the grave as the rampaging zombie Lady Stoneheart isn't going to happen in the TV show. Dragons, White Walkers, giants, time travel: fine. Undead Michelle Fairley? Don't be absurd. During season 6, fans began pondering whether the character of Lady Stoneheart could be morphed into Sansa Stark instead, as she may go on a vengeance tour now that she's finally free and "safe" with Jon Snow and friends.

However, it makes far more sense for the Stoneheart persona to be passed onto her little sister Arya. She proved her assassin-like qualities in the finale, finally showing off her training from Jaqen and murdering Walder Frey.

While we can't see them turning Arya into a speechless zombie who kills everyone, we can at least imagine her adding several more people to her kill list and becoming a seriously dangerous assassin that people begin to follow.
