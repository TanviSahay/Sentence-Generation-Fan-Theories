Jon will marry Daenerys. We're not sure about this one. Although Daenerys did hint at a tactical marriage at the end of Season 6, we're not sure she'd need to marry Jon to get him on side. You never know, though (and the fact that he's her nephew definitely wouldn't be a big deal if Targaryen history is anything to go by). (Or, at the very least, they'll be allies.) To us, this seems the most likely option for Season 7. They're both powerful, wary characters, and we can imagine their allegiance being a tense one until they get to know each other properly (or at least until Tyrion's thawed the ice).
