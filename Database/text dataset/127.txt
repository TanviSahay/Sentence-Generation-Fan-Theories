Jon Snow is (Presumably) a Targaryen.

The popular Game of Thrones theory R+L=J theory proposes that Jon Snow is the child of Lyanna Stark, Ned's deceased sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys's older brother and the eldest son of Mad King Aerys II. And now, we know it's true ... at least, it sure looks that way, according to what we saw in the Season 6 finale.
