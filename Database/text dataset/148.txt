Joffrey's Head On The Mountain. Oh, Zombie Mountain... I love you. This theory is equal parts crazy and awesome. If it's true (I really don't think it is), this would be amazing. Redditor Piscator629 thinks that crazy Qyburn sewed Joffrey's head onto The Mountain's body. The reasoning is pretty simple. In the books, The Mountain's head is sent back to Dorne as a symbol of Oberyn killing him and, from what we have seen, Zombie Mountain has blue eyes like Joffrey. When he was alive, The Mountain had is darker eyes. Also, we have yet to get a clear picture of zombie mountain without his helmet on. Even in the season finale, when he removed his helmet, it was in the dark. We didn't get a very clear picture. Of course, what we did see didn't really look like Joffrey, but stranger things have happened.
