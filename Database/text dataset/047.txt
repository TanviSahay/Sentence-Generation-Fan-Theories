The Night's King will invade. This is what the whole thing's been building up to, isn't it? It probably won't happen until towards the end of Season 7, but it won't be long now before the Night's King makes his move.

Showrunner David Benioff basically said as much when asked about the Horn of Joramun — a legendary device believed to hold the power to topple The Wall — in a recent interview for Deadline Hollywood.

"If the Wildlings managed to make it over, which they have, and the Night King has so much more in the way of both power and troops who'll do literally anything he says... We'll leave it at that for now," said Benioff.
