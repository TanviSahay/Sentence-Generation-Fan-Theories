Jon Snow is Azor Ahai.

Azor Ahai is a legendary hero who defeated the Others with his flaming sword, Lightbringer, which was forged by stabbing his wife through the heart. According to the prophecy, Azor Ahai will be "reborn amidst salt and smoke" to fight the Others when they return. Plus ... Melisandre originally believed Stannis Baratheon was the Prince That Was Promised, while many fans believe Jon Snow is the legendary hero. His death and subsequent rezzing could also lead to a very literal interpretation of the legendary hero's "rebirth."
