Jon Snow's real name isn't Jon. As we've already said, we're 99% certain that Jon's real dad is actually the late Rhaegar Targaryen, although the show didn't actually make this clear in the finale.

One fan on Reddit has tried to deduce what Ned's dying sister Lyanna whispers after giving birth to Jon. Though quiet, "His name is" can be heard, but the rest of the sentence is inaudible (the gits). However, by reading her lips the user reckons she says a name that starts with a J and is three syllables long.

"I'm not a great lip-reader, but I'm fairly certain what she says is Jaehaerys," sparkledavisjr said. "The name is not included in the captions, probably on purpose." What is the significance of Jaehaerys? Well, two previous Targaryen kings shared that name, and the first was known as one of the greatest ever kings, having expanded the Night's Watch, constructed the Kingsroad, restored peace between the Crown and the Faith and helped improve King's Landing.

However, at the time of Jon's birth all Targaryens were either being killed or in hiding, and so Lyanna and Rhaegar's son would be in danger, despite being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Thus, Lyanna made Ned promise to take him in as his own.

Though he clearly couldn't go back home saying that the baby's name was little Jaehaerys without the Lannisters or Baratheons piping up going "Erm, he's clearly a Targaryen then, kill the little shit". Instead, he named him Jon. Much easier.
