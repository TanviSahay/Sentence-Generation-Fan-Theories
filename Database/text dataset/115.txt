SANSA WILL BETRAY JON. This is a Digital Spy exclusive, though chances are you may have thought it too. The last time we saw Sansa, she bizarrely lied to Jon about how she found out about her uncle Brynden "The Blackfish" Tully taking over Riverrun. In reality, she was told by Littlefinger, but she made out that she intercepted a raven while being held captive by Ramsay.

The reason? Maybe because Littlefinger pointed out how Jon is really just her half-brother, and thus she is the true Stark heir and leader (true, Bran and Rickon are still around, but she doesn't know that, and we're not sure where the North stands on female vs male primogeniture). Lest we forget, Sansa was quite the cow in the first season, especially to Jon.

Maybe she'll go back to her old ways now that she's safe and has power and will betray Jon when push comes to shove? We hope not, but we wouldn't be surprised.
