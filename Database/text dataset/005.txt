Euron Greyjoy Will Return.

The uncle of Yara and Theon Greyjoy will likely return in Season 7 and he’s got big plans. Several fan theories suggest that he will be out for power when he returns to the show and will do anything to get it. His initial plan may be to woo the Mother of Dragons, but she’s well aware of his tricks thanks to her new alliance with his family members.

Another fan theory, posted on Tumblr by user Poor Quentyn, suggests that Euron (Pilou Asbæk may be looking to acquire a horn called the Dragonbinder. The instrument can be used to become the master of dragons. In the books, Euron has it, but that has yet to be seen in the show. Poor Quentyn suggests that Sam is in possession of it and Euron may use force to obtain it for himself. This theory makes sense, as in the “A Song of Ice and Fire” novels, off which the show is based, Euron attacks Oldtown, where Sam is studying to be a maester.

Another clue into Euron’s return comes from a Season 6 quote from Jon Snow. In the finale he discusses the White Walkers coming, suggesting that something much worse may be coming for them.

“The true enemy won’t wait out the storm,” Jon Snow said. “He brings the storm.”

As Huffington Post points out, during an earlier episode Euron referenced “the storm.” Talking to his brother Balon (Patrick Malahide) prior to his death, Euron calls himself “the storm.”

“I am the storm, brother,” he said. “The first storm and the last.”
