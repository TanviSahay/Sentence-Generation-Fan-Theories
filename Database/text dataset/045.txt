Cleganebowl WILL happen. Maybe. Sandor Clegane has been brought back into the show for a reason, dammit. Obviously his character represents the struggle between redemption and the desire for revenge, etc. (not to mention the need to be a cold, axe-wielding badass in order to survive in the Thrones world), but he still has to actually do something next season.

Cersei's downfall will surely come before the end of the show, and one of the few remaining barriers between the new Queen and an early grave is her formidable protector, Ser Gregor.

The Hound is headed North at the moment, but at some point he'll likely encounter the Starks and hopefully get drafted onto their team. And if they decide to ally with Daenerys in her quest for the Iron Throne? Well, frankly we can't think of a better candidate to go toe-to-toe with the Mountain than his very own flesh and blood.
