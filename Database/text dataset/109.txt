Jaqen IS the Many Faced God. One Redditor has put forward the claim that perhaps Arya's former teacher wasn't just following the Many Faced God. He actually is the big man himself.

Not only does Jaqen have the ability to change his face like his other Faceless Men pals, but he has proven to have extra powers, like taking away Arya's sight at will. Could there be more to him than he's let on? It would be odd if we just didn't see him ever again now that Arya has left him behind.

We've seen this season how characters seem to have a path or a purpose (like Hodor holding the door). As The Three-Eyed Raven said, "the past is already written", so maybe Jaqen knows how important Arya is, and that's why he's taken such a keen interest in her life.

Maybe The Waif's whole existence was purely to help Arya get to the next stage of her quest? The Three-Eyed Raven made sure Bran and Hodor were where they needed to be at the right time, as he already knew it. Could Jaqen have similar plans for Arya?
