Jaime will kill Cersei.

Earlier this season, fans theorised that Jaime Lannister will be forced to kill his sister/lover to stop her from unleashing a load of wildfire in King's Landing, much like he did with the Mad King before the show began. As we now know, Cersei carried out her plan without being halted by anyone, but tore down the Great Sept of Baelor rather than the whole damned place. However, Jaime returned and looked on in horror at what she had done, at how it had led to the death of their last child Tommen and how it elevated her to the Iron Throne.

In both the show and the books, Cersei was told in flashback by a woman named Maggy the Frog (just go with it) that she would have three children, and that after seeing them crowned she would watch all of them die one after the other.

Now that we've said goodbye to all three kids, the next bit of the prophecy states that Cersei will be strangled to death by someone known as "the Valonqar". In Valyrian, this translates as "little brother" or "younger sibling". While you (and she) might assume this was her hated younger brother, the dwarf Tyrion, it could actually mean Jaime, who was born just after his twin sister.

Maybe Jaime will finally see sense and realise he's meant to be with Brienne? Or are we shipping too hard?
